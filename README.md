## Project Description
CramPlan is a last-minute study planner that helps students organize their exam preparation efficiently. Users input their exam details, syllabus, and study materials, and the app generates a personalized, prioritized study plan complete with condensed notes and a study schedule.

## The Problem Statement
Students often find themselves overwhelmed with too much to study and too little time before exams, with no clear strategy on what to prioritize or how to allocate their remaining hours.

## The Solution
CramPlan takes the student's exam date/time, syllabus chapters, study materials, and reading speed, then uses AI to generate a prioritized study plan with condensed notes for each topic — helping students focus on what matters most in the time they have left.
